Email Authentication System - Simple Overview
This project is a user authentication system that verifies a person’s identity through email. It is built using Java and designed with clean, organized code following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Main Features:
Email Verification: When a user signs up, they receive a one-time password (OTP) via email. This ensures that only users with valid email addresses can access the system.
Object-Oriented Design: The project uses basic OOP concepts like organizing code into classes and methods, making it easier to update and manage.
JavaMail API: This project includes the ability to send emails directly from the system using Java’s built-in tools.
Secure Login Process: After receiving an OTP, users must enter it to complete their registration or login, adding an extra layer of security.
Well-Organized Code: The project is built with clear, separate parts, making it simple to understand, improve, or add new features.
This system demonstrates a basic yet effective way to add email authentication to a Java-based application.
